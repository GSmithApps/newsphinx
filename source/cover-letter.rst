Cover Letter
============

**Purpose of document**: explain the role type I'm looking for and how I
might fit.

**Role Type**: I'd like to work as a developer advocate, content
creator, instructor, programmer, or something related.

My Approach
===========

Learners first, beauty second
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I think the most important thing is doing a service to the
customers/learners/students. Behind that is the beauty of the ideas
we're exploring.

As in `Grant Sanderson's talk about Ego and
Math <https://youtu.be/z7GVHB2wiyg?si=Awn7ybl3HRXZRCEW>`__ (and in my
comment on the video that he responded to), I want to be of service to
people. To me, the most important thing is making something that people
appreciate.

And behind that, I find beauty in computer science, so I'd like to do
justice to that. This sense of beauty is part of what me passionate
about the subject.

Approaching Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One thing I do is approach work like a programmer. For example, I like
to use git, code, and markdown.

I also like to record things so other people can use them in the future.
For example, instead of sending an email or taking my own notes, I try
to put them in some documentation so other people can use them.
Continuing on this, I am an avid documenter and note taker, and my
coworkers recognize and value it.

Innovation
~~~~~~~~~~

I am passionate about innovation. I'm always trying to use the best
technologies I can find, and I'm always wanting to learn. I use ChatGPT
and CoPilot extensively in my programming, and I'm always looking for
the next thing.

Teaching Principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When teaching of developing curriculum or documentation, I have a few
guiding principles:

**Explain things so well that the audience feels like they could have
discovered it**. I really like this one, and Grant Sanderson advocates
it as well.

**Make sure the audience can recreate what you're doing.** I really like
the way Sal Khan does this one. He always manually draws things or does
live coding, and I think that's part of why his content resonates so
well. The audience can follow along and create what he's creating as he
goes. I do this with my GeoGebra YouTube tutorials… I try to make them
so the audience can follow along, build it themselves, and start to
build their own experiments. It's like teaching someone to fish rather
than giving them a fish.

Culture
=======

I know that culture is tricky to steer, and it isn't one-size-fits-all,
but here are some things that I seem to value:

-  Mutual trust
-  People who look out for each other
-  Flexibility
-  Passion
-  Growth
-  Curiosity
-  Openness
-  Willingness to try new things
-  Sense of humor

And, given that these are some things I value, I hope to bring these
myself. Also, I hope to adopt the values that other people have, so I
can be part of them enjoying themselves as well.

Industry
========

My instinct is that the industry matters less to me than the
role/position and culture, but there are some industries that would
interest me. In particular, I care a lot about things such as

-  education
-  technology
-  AI and large language models
-  personal development
-  clear thinking
-  mental health

So, if I could work on something in one of those areas or something
related, that would be a plus for me.

Full Time Vs Contract
=====================

All of my roles so far have been full time, and I think I want to try
contract. I'm still open to both, but contract work seems like it might
be worth a try because I like to try new things and experience different
positions.

AI
==

I am on board with using AI and LLMs. I have found them to help me out a
lot in many areas of life, especially including learning and work. So
for me, I want to continue using them in my work, and ideally I'd help
integrate it into any products I'm working on.

Evidence of Ability
===================

I know that I like to present and teach, and the evidence I see shows
that my students and audience think I'm effective at that. As mentioned
in the resume, my students all give me very good ratings, and at the
career fair, I made enough impact that the students were looking for me
the following year. And I have presented at various meetups and enjoyed
it and got a lot of positive feedback from the other members in the
groups.

A Story About Me and Math
=========================

Last year, one of my best friends was getting married, and I was one of
the speakers at the wedding reception. As his dad was introducing me
before the speech, he told the story of how when his son and I were in
high school, his wife was getting an MBA, and she was having some
trouble in her statistics class. They thought, “what better tutor than
Grant?”, and so there I was, as a high school student, helping my
friend's mom through her MBA statistics course. She passed the class,
and we all lived to tell the tale and get a good laugh.
