Work History
============


This section is in reverse-chronological order, as normal. Note that
there is an arc of starting as a chemical engineer, and moving slowly
toward being a programmer.

Quantitative Developer
----------------------

I currently work as a quantitative software developer in Security
Benefit's Derivatives group. This means I implement the financial models
that valuate options and other financial derivatives.

-  I have worked here since May 2022.
-  We mostly work in Python.
-  I am part of our group's leadership committee.
-  I started the group's documentation effort, and now we have a full
   static site using MKDocs.

Here are a few quotes from my coworkers:

-  What I really appreciate about Grant is how proactive he is. Simply
   put, he makes problems go away.
-  I have not met a more team-first person than Grant.
-  I keep finding Grant's documentation in here and it keeps saving my
   butt.

Business Intelligence Developer
-------------------------------

Before leaving to go back to school for a master's degree, I worked as a
business intelligence developer at Black and Veatch. We worked
extensively with Power BI, Azure, SQL, and the Microsoft Power Stack. I
left because I felt like I wanted to do something more quantitative and
more programming-ey.

Software Developer
------------------

Before being a business intelligence developer, I worked for a startup
subsidiary inside Black and Veatch that was then called Atonix Digital.
While there, I started on the implementation team (getting my foot in
the door… as mentioned, I was moving my career toward being a
programmer), and then worked my way into being a programmer. I finally
did it and got my position as a programmer, and I worked on our UI as an
Angular Developer. Then, as the startup was trying to get purchased by
an outside company, COVID hit, and the offers dried up, and I was still
a pretty new programmer, so I was in the ~2/3 of the company that they
simultaneously let go. I did get a position back in the main Black and
Veatch as a business intelligence developer.

Data Manager
------------

I worked on a project as a data manager. I worked in a trailer in
Johnson City Tennessee at the Boone Dam construction site. I wore a hard
hat and steel toed boots, and managed the streams of data that the
construction sensors and the dam monitoring sensors measured. This was a
great experience for me, and I learned a lot. And when I was finished at
the project, that's when I got my foot in the door at Atonix Digital on
the implementation team.

Chemical Engineer
-----------------

I started my career as a chemical process engineer in Black and Veatch's
Oil and Gas division. This job was great and chemical engineering is
very interesting, but it was in this role that I started getting into
programming. In my downtime, I worked on software tools for the group. I
realized that I wanted to move my career toward programming, so I
started looking for related projects, and that's when I got the
opportunity as a data manager.

Engagement
==========


Meetup Presentations
--------------------

I've given a few talks at meetups over the past few years. Among them
are a set of six talks (one of which wasn't recorded) to the `East Bay
Deep Learning
Club <https://www.meetup.com/east-bay-tri-valley-machine-learning-meetup/>`__.
Here is the `link to the YouTube
playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLytZkHFJwKUf-P1Q_AD-hvYKyH0VREKWw>`__.

YouTube Videos
--------------

Since 2017, I have been lightly making YouTube videos – most of which
have been about math and programming. `Here is a

Teaching
--------

Data Analytics Boot Camp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I taught a data analytics boot camp through EdX and Ohio State
University. Class was in the evenings, and I taught it after work. It
was two nights per week for 2.5 hours, and it lasted 6 months. It
covered tons of things from excel VBA to MongoDB to deep learning. It
makes me very proud that my students all gave me a 5/5 rating on my
official review, but since that wasn't published, I asked them to rate
me on rate my professor, and the ones that did gave me a 5/5. `Here is
the
link <https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2720862>`__
and some quotes from my students

-  Super friendly, kind, nice and caring. You can tell he truly loves
   what he does! Definitely recommend and take again.
   `(link) <https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/rating/35222252?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=prof_rating>`__
-  He has an uncanny ability to sense when your ADHD brain begins to
   zone out and immediately refocuses the class.

Pre-Calc at KU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also, as a grad student at KU, I taught two courses of pre-calculus.
Again, I am very proud to say that `my students all gave me a 5/5
rating <https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2771200>`__.

Career Fair Representative
--------------------------

In my current job, I'm one of our main developers that goes to career
fairs. I think I am good at interfacing with students. And in 2023, I
couldn't make it to the career fair, and the person who went in my place
said that students kept approaching him asking where I was, because they
remembered me from the year before. Also, the year I went, we
successfully hired two of the candidates I found.

Fraternity President
--------------------

As an undergraduate, I was in a fraternity at KU. I know many people
don't like fraternities, and I agree with a lot of that. I only mention
it here because it was a very big responsibility. For example, the house
was a big one on campus and around 70 members lived there, and I was
responsible for their well-being, as a 20 year old.

Leadership Certificate
----------------------

As an undergraduate, I also earned a leadership certificate, which
involved taking some management courses, going on a retreat called
LeaderShape (on which I was asked to return the following year as one of
three student coordinators), and being involved on campus.

Marketing Specialist
--------------------

When I was in high school, I worked for a subshop (Firehouse Subs… very
tasty), and in the summer when we set up a tent on the street corner to
give out samples, our manager always had me be the one working the tent
to interact with potential customers.

Education
=========

Chemical Engineering Bachelor's
-------------------------------

I studied chemical engineering at KU as an undergraduate. I liked it a
lot, and learned a lot of interesting science and mathematics. In the
narrow sense, I don't use it in my day-to-day, but I still think like a
scientist and chemical engineer in a lot of ways.

Business Minor
--------------

As an undergraduate, I also got a minor in business. I took courses on
finance, accounting, management, etc.

Masters in Mathematics
----------------------

I've been poking around in further studies ever since I left undergrad.
Within a year, I had enrolled in an online masters in mathematics. I was
taking complex variables and proofs, but I didn't finish those courses.
It didn't seem very effective for me at the time. And then in 2021, I
enrolled at UMKC as a masters of mathematics student, and I took
abstract algebra while working, and that went well. That was the only
course I took, though. And then most recently, I enrolled in a
full-time, in-person masters of mathematics program at KU. I did one
semester, got an intership that summer, and then decided to stick around
full time.

AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
--------------------------------

In May 2022, I got certified as an AWS Cloud Practitioner. `Here is my
badge <https://www.credly.com/badges/3c754523-d992-47d9-b500-d7b5b18daf92/public_url>`__
